Q2:
size 1000
sort(): 0.000228 seconds
v1/v2 are different.
insertion_sort(): 0.011712 seconds
v1/v2 are the same.

size 10000
sort(): 0.002927 seconds
v1/v2 are different.
insertion_sort(): 1.04067 seconds
v1/v2 are the same.

size 100000
sort(): 0.03707 seconds
v1/v2 are different.
insertion_sort(): 102.485 seconds
v1/v2 are the same.

size 1000000
sort(): 0.481606 seconds
v1/v2 are different.
insertion_sort(): 12960.4 seconds
v1/v2 are the same.

we can know that sort is faster than insertion_sort.
sort is O(nlogn), and insertion_sort is O(n^2).
sort is better than insertion_sort, and saves time.
